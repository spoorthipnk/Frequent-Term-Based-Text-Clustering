does data mining work?
While large-scale information technology been evolving separate transaction analytical systems, data mining provides link between . Data mining software analyzes relationships patternsstored transaction data basedopen-ended user queries. Several typesanalytical software available: statistical, machine learning, neural networks. Generally, four typesrelationships sought:
�	Classes: Stored datausedlocate datapredetermined groups. examplerestaurant chain mine customer purchase datadetermine customers visit they typically order. information usedincrease traffichaving daily specials.
�	Clusters: Data items grouped accordinglogical relationshipsconsumer preferences. example, data minedidentify market segmentsconsumer affinities.
�	Associations: Data minedidentify associations. beer-diaper exampleexampleassociative mining.
�	Sequential patterns: Dataminedanticipate behavior patterns trends. example, outdoor equipment retailer predict likelihoodbackpack being purchased basedconsumerpurchasesleeping bags hiking shoes.
Data mining consistsfive major elements:
�	Extract, transform, load transaction data onto data warehouse system.
�	Store manage datamultidimensional database system.
�	Provide data accessbusiness analysts information technology professionals.
�	Analyze dataapplication software.
�	Present datauseful format, suchgraphtable.
Different levelsanalysis available:
�	Artificial neural networks: -linear predictive models learn through training resemble biological neural networksstructure.
�	Genetic algorithms: Optimization techniques processes suchgenetic combination, mutation, natural selectiondesign basedconceptsnatural evolution.
�	Decision trees: Tree-shaped structures represent setsdecisions. These decisions generate rules classificationdataset. Specific decision tree methods include Classification Regression Trees (CART) Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) . CART CHAID decision tree techniques used classificationdataset. They providerules apply(unclassified) datasetpredict records given outcome. CART segmentsdatasetcreatingsplits while CHAID segments using square testscreate multi-splits. CART typically requires less data preparation than CHAID.
