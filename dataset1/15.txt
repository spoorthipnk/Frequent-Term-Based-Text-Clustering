Log-linear models approximate discrete multidimensional probability distributions. Given a set of tuples in n dimensions (e.g., described by n attributes), we
can consider each tuple as a point in an n-dimensional space. Log-linear models
can be used to estimate the probability of each point in a multidimensional space
for a set of discretized attributes, based on a smaller subset of dimensional combinations. This allows a higher-dimensional data space to be constructed from lowerdimensional spaces. Log-linear models are therefore also useful for dimensionality
reduction (since the lower-dimensional points together typically occupy less space
than the original data points) and data smoothing (since aggregate estimates in the
lower-dimensional space are less subject to sampling variations than the estimates in
the higher-dimensional space).
Regression and log-linear models can both be used on sparse data, although their
application may be limited. While both methods can handle skewed data, regression does
exceptionally well. Regression can be computationally intensive when applied to highdimensional data, whereas log-linear models show good scalability for up to 10 or so
dimensions.
