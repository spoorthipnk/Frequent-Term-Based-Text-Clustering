Data Cube Aggregation
Imagine that you have collected the data for your analysis. These data consist of the
AllElectronics sales per quarter, for the years 2002 to 2004. You are, however, interested
in the annual sales (total per year), rather than the total per quarter. Thus the data
can be aggregated so that the resulting data summarize the total sales per year instead
of per quarter. This aggregation is illustrated in Figure 2.13. The resulting data set is
smaller in volume, without loss of information necessary for the analysis task.
Data cubes are discussed in detail in Chapter 3 on data warehousing. We brie?y
introduce some concepts here. Data cubes store multidimensional aggregated information. For example, Figure 2.14 shows a data cube for multidimensional analysis of
sales data with respect to annual sales per item type for each AllElectronics branch.
Each cell holds an aggregate data value, corresponding to the data point in multidimensional space.
