Binning
Binning is a top-down splitting technique based on a speci?ed number of bins.
Section 2.3.2 discussed binning methods for data smoothing. These methods are
also used as discretization methods for numerosity reduction and concept hierarchy
generation. For example, attribute values can be discretized by applying equal-width
or equal-frequency binning, and then replacing each bin value by the bin mean or
median, as in smoothing by bin means or smoothing by bin medians, respectively. These
techniques can be applied recursively to the resulting partitions in order to generate concept hierarchies. Binning does not use class information and is therefore an
unsupervised discretization technique. It is sensitive to the user-speci?ed number of
bins, as well as the presence of outliers.
