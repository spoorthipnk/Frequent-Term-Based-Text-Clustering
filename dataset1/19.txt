Entropy-Based Discretization
Entropy is one of the most commonly used discretization measures. It was ?rst introduced by Claude Shannon in pioneering work on information theory and the concept
of information gain. Entropy-based discretization is a supervised, top-down splitting
technique. It explores class distribution information in its calculation and determination
of split-points (data values for partitioning an attribute range). To discretize a numerical attribute, A, the method selects the value of A that has the minimum entropy as a
split-point, and recursively partitions the resulting intervals to arrive at a hierarchical
discretization. Such discretization forms a concept hierarchy for A.
Let D consist of data tuples de?ned by a set of attributes and a class-label attribute.
The class-label attribute provides the class information per tuple
