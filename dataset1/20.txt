Cluster Analysis
Cluster analysis is a popular data discretization method. A clustering algorithm can be
applied to discretize a numerical attribute, A, by partitioning the values of A into clusters
or groups. Clustering takes the distribution of A into consideration, as well as the closeness of data points, and therefore is able to produce high-quality discretization results.
Clustering can be used to generate a concept hierarchy for A by following either a topdown splitting strategy or a bottom-up merging strategy, where each cluster forms a
node of the concept hierarchy. In the former, each initial cluster or partition may be further decomposed into several subclusters, forming a lower level of the hierarchy.
Discretization by Intuitive Partitioning
Although the above discretization methods are useful in the generation of numerical
hierarchies, many users would like to see numerical ranges partitioned into relatively
uniform, easy-to-read intervals that appear intuitive or “natural.”
