Dimensionality Reduction
In dimensionality reduction, data encoding or transformations are applied so as to obtain
a reduced or “compressed” representation of the original data. If the original data can
be reconstructed from the compressed data without any loss of information, the data
reduction is called lossless. If, instead, we can reconstruct only an approximation of
the original data, then the data reduction is called lossy. There are several well-tuned
algorithms for string compression. Although they are typically lossless, they allow only
limited manipulation of the data. In this section, we instead focus on two popular and
effective methods of lossy dimensionality reduction: wavelet transforms and principal
components analysis.
Wavelet Transforms
The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is a linear signal processing technique that, when
applied to a data vector X, transforms it to a numerically different vector, X
'
, of wavelet
coef?cients. The two vectors are of the same length
