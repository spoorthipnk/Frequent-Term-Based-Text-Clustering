Numerosity Reduction
“Can we reduce the data volume by choosing alternative, ‘smaller’ forms of data representation?” Techniques of numerosity reduction can indeed be applied for this purpose.
These techniques may be parametric or nonparametric. For parametric methods, a
model is used to estimate the data, so that typically only the data parameters need to
be stored, instead of the actual data. (Outliers may also be stored.) Log-linear models,
which estimate discrete multidimensional probability distributions, are an example.
Nonparametric methods for storing reduced representations of the data include histograms, clustering, and sampling.
Let’s look at each of the numerosity reduction techniques mentioned above
