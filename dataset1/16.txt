Clustering
Clustering techniques consider data tuples as objects. They partition the objects into
groups or clusters, so that objects within a cluster are “similar” to one another and
“dissimilar” to objects in other clusters. Similarity is commonly de?ned in terms of how
“close” the objects are in space, based on a distance function. The “quality” of a cluster
may be represented by its diameter, the maximum distance between any two objects in
the cluster. Centroid distance is an alternative measure of cluster quality and is de?ned as
the average distance of each cluster object from the cluster centroid (denoting the “average object,” or average point in space for the cluster). Figure 2.12 of Section 2.3.2 shows a
2-D plot of customer data with respect to customer locations in a city, where the centroid
of each cluster is shown with a “+”. Three data clusters are visible.
In data reduction, the cluster representations of the data are used to replace the
actual data. The effectiveness of this technique depends on the nature of the data. It
is much more effective for data that can be organized into distinct clusters than for
smeared data.
